    <p style="color:coral"> <p style="font-size: larger;"  I love icecream a lot. Since a young girl I have always enjoyed flavors such as strawberry, cookies and cream, and cookie dough. 
        One of my favorite icecreams is dip-n-dots. These small balls of icecrean melt in your mouth, and bring you back to your childhood.></p>
