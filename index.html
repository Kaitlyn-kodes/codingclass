    <p style="background-color: crimson;"><strong>I love icecream a lot. Since a young girl I have always enjoyed flavors such as strawberry, cookies and cream, and cookie dough. </strong> 
        One of my favorite icecreams is dip-n-dots. These small balls of icecrean melt in your mouth, and bring you back to your childhood.</p>
